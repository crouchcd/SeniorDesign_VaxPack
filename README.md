# PIC-Microcontroller-Boards
This project contains code and related documents for controlling a portable refrigerator with a 16-bit Microchip device. 

Current Items:
***
1.  LCD Demo
2.  PWM Demo (not related to the refrigerator)
3.  External Interrupt Demo
4.  3x4 Keypad interfacing with PIC24
5.  ADC code for reading a (16.8-13.5 V) battery supply and a MCP9700 temperature sensor
..* Two external circuits for generating the appropriate reference voltages for each ADC channel
